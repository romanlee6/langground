This text game defines a simulation environment for a predator-prey game.
This environment is a grid where predator and prey agents interact.
The goal for predators is to catch the prey by reaching the same location as the prey.

### Observation Space

The observation space for each predator is defined by its immediate surroundings, specifically a square area around it determined by the `vision` parameter.
This means that a predator can only observe objects (other predators or prey) within this area.
This setup allows agents to have a localized view of the environment, simulating limited perception.


### Action Space

The action space for the predators is discrete.
Predators can move in four directions (up, right, down, left) and optionally stay in place if the `stay` action is enabled.
Prey can not move.

### Communication

Predators might send communication messages to each other to share information and coordinate searching.

### Reward

The reward structure is designed to encourage certain behaviors in the agents.
Predators receive a small negative reward (-0.05) at each timestep to encourage them to catch the prey quickly.
If a predator successfully reaches the prey location, it receives a positive reward.
The exact reward depends on the mode of the game (cooperative, competitive, mixed, or parent-child), which affects how rewards are distributed among multiple predators.
For example, in cooperative mode, all predators on a prey receive the same reward, while in competitive mode, the reward is divided among the predators on the prey.

### Environment Dynamics

The environment simulates the movement of agents based on their actions and updates their positions on the grid.
It checks for conditions like reaching the prey or going out of bounds and updates the game state accordingly.
The episode ends when all predators reach the prey location.

In summary, this environment is a simulation of a predator-prey game where agents must learn to navigate a grid to achieve their objectives, using only their local perception of the environment.
The learning process is driven by the rewards received for their actions, encouraging the development of strategies for catching the prey.
