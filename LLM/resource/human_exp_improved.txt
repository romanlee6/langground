This text game defines a simulation environment for a predator-prey game.
This environment is a grid where predator and prey agents interact.
The goal for predators is to catch the prey by reaching the same location as the prey.

### Observation Space

The observation space for each predator is defined by its immediate surroundings, specifically a square area around it determined by the `vision` parameter.
This means that a predator can only observe objects (other predators or prey) within this area.


### Action Space

The action space for the predators is discrete.
Predators can move in four directions (up, right, down, left) and optionally stay in place if the `stay` action is enabled.
Prey can not move and remain in its original location all the time.

### Communication

Predators might send communication messages to each other to share information and coordinate searching.

### Goal

The goal of task is for all the predators to reach the exact prey location as soon as possible.

### Environment Dynamics

The environment simulates the movement of agents based on their actions and updates their positions on the grid.
The agent location is described as two coordinates [x, y], in which x indicates the axis from north to south and y indicates the axis from west to east.
When agent move 1-step up, the value of x coordinate decrease by 1.
When agent move 1-step down, the value of x coordinate increase by 1.
When agent move 1-step left, the value of y coordinate decrease by 1.
When agent move 1-step right, the value of y coordinate increase by 1.
It checks for conditions like reaching the prey or going out of bounds and updates the game state accordingly.
The episode ends when all predators reach the prey location.


In summary, this environment is a simulation of a predator-prey game where agents must coordinate to search for the prey using only their local perception of the environment.
